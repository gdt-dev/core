name: stop-on-fail
description: |
    a scenario that tests that a failed assertion for a stop-on-fail
    test spec prevents subsequent test specs from being executed.
tests:
  - exec: echo "meaning of life"
    assert:
      out:
        is: 1234
  # This test should be executed because we do not use the require: true.
  - exec: echo 42
    assert:
      require: true
      out:
        is: 24
  # This test should not be executed because of the use of require: true above
  - exec: echo 24
