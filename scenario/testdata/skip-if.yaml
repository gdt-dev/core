name: skip-if
description: a scenario with a skip-if condition
skip-if:
  - foo: bar
    # This causes the evaluation to succeed (expects name=bar when foo=bar)
    name: bar
tests:
  - foo: bar
    # Normally this would cause the test to fail, but this will be skipped due
    # to the skip-if above succeeding.
